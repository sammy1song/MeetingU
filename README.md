# MeetingU

The MeetingU programâ€™s vision is to be the global connection platform for middle school and high school students to second-hand lely experience college life. It promotes high standards and educational purposes for adolescents to grasp and understand about colleges and beyond. MeetingU is a forward-thinking global medium, powered by a diverse team of employees committed to making the transition to college life unchallenging for high school students. Our business goal for the first year is to help out high school students in Texas, South Korea, and China to get university consulting options ready for various colleges and expand throughout the country.
